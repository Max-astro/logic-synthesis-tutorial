 A collection of tutorials and hands-on examples for learning logic synthesis. This repository covers fundamental concepts like Truth Table (Kitty), Binary Decision Diagrams (CUDD), and SAT solvers(Z3), as well as more advanced topics like And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) and technology mapping in the Mockturtle library. The tutorials include practical code using popular libraries such as CUDD, Z3, and mockturtle to solve classic problems like N-Queens and Sudoku, and to demonstrate the implementation of logic synthesis algorithms.
